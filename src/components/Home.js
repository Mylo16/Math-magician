        <p>
          Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers,
          formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are
          contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented
          in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory,[1]
          algebra,[2] geometry,[1] and analysis,[3][4] respectively. There is no
          general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for
          their academic discipline.

          Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of abstract
          objects and the use of pure reason to prove them. These objects consist of either
          abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated
          to have certain properties, called axioms. A proof consists of a succession of
          applications of deductive rules to already established results. These results
          include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from
          nature—some
          basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under
          consideration.[5]
